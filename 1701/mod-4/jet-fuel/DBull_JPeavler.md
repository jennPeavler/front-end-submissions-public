## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

We were able to complete all functionality excepting entirely completing the sort functionality.  We did get popularity sort working on first click, but ran out of time to finish that part of functionality.
We were also short on time to dry up code, so there is a lot of clean up that still needs to be done, including taking out some areas where code is a bit more hard-coded that ideal.


#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

N/A, no extensions provided

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[server happy code](https://github.com/jennPeavler/jetFuel/blob/master/server/server.js#L1-L24)
[router happy code](https://github.com/jennPeavler/jetFuel/blob/master/server/router.js#L1-L11)
[api functions happy code](https://github.com/jennPeavler/jetFuel/blob/master/server/api.js#L1-L99)

We were really happy about setting up our server using the router and breaking out the functions into a separate file.
Thought the code looked really clean and easy to follow.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jennPeavler/jetFuel/blob/master/client/assets/scripts/script.js#L33-L198)

Well, are you kidding, of course I'm sad about this, it's a 170 line function!  We know how to dry up this code we just
ran out of time.  Using vanilla was particularily challenging because we had to use so many extra lines for to generate our css within our javascript....

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

[test suite](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3ItQVupdvvgQUU0MGdRUndQSkE)

We are testing happy paths on all of our requests, and sand paths on a few.  We ran out of time to do all sad paths.  We also did not get to client side testing....

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Comment from Jenn Peavler:  Why the mandate to use vanilla or JQuery?  I spent a lot of time de-rustifying my vanilla and I thought that
detracted from the time I spent exploring server/client server/database interactions.  One solution would be in the prework to mod4, 
tell students to refresh on their vanilla/jQuery skills so that there's not so much struggle with those basics.

Other than that, thanks!  I learned a lot through this project.

Comment from Devon Bull:  Wanted to have a more complete lesson on how to set up testing database.
